- Remembers what transport mode you were in when entering an interior location.
- When exiting an interior location, this mod will automatically sets player's transport mode to what it was when they entered it.
- Example: You enter a dungeon on a horse. When you exit, you will be put back on a horse.
  - Without this quality of life mod, you will instead be on the foot transport mode when exiting, which is much slower. So, you would have to manually select horse from the transport menu, every single time you exit any interior location.
