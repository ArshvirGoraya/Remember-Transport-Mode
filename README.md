# Auto Horse Mod For Daggerfall Unity

Source for Auto Horse mod for [Daggerfall Unity](https://github.com/Interkarma/daggerfall-unity), an open source recreation of The Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall.

## What Does the Mod Do?

- When exiting buildings/dungeons, it automatically puts the player on a horse so you don't have to go through the transport menu and do it each time yourself.
- Only works if a player has bought a horse.
