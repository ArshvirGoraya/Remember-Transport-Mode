# Remember Transport Mode Mod For Daggerfall Unity

Source for Remember Transport Mode mod for [Daggerfall Unity](https://github.com/Interkarma/daggerfall-unity), an open source recreation of The Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall.

## What Does the Mod Do?

- Remembers what transport mode you were in when entering an interior location.
- When exiting interior location, automatically sets player's transport mode to what it was when they entered it.
- Example: You enter a dungeon on a horse. When you exit, you will be put back on a horse.
  - Without this mod, you will simply be on foot when exiting, and would have to manually select horse from the transport menu, every single time you exit a interior location.
